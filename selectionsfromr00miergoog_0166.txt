Reginum} of the Republic

Pege 1. 1. In the first book, Livy hes related the traditional
history oi Rome under the luinge, who ruled ior lile and were not re-
sponsible to the people. Henceiorth (iam latae) he is to describe the
affairs oi the free Roman people‚ ie. the Republic‚ said to have been
founded in no. 509. He thinks the most important new features in
the republican organization were magistrates elected annually and the
supreme authority oi laws over all individuale. A magistrate was
elected hy the people end, though he could not he removed from office,
yet alter his term was completed‚ he could be punished ior maladmin-
istration end was thus held responsible. Laws were now made by the
people and even the magistrates were bound to obey them, whereas
formerly the king was above the laws. Livy does not bring out the
fact that the chiei executive authority oi the Republic was vested in
two eoequal magistrates (the consuls), which according to medem
views was one oi the most important features oi the republican gov-
crement, since each consul could act as e check on the other. (Οἱ.
