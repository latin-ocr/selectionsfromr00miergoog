Ireiier 28. After Caesar had taken possession oi Rome and the
state treesure and made arrangemeuts ior the governmeut oi Italy and
the command oi the troops during his absence, he set out on the
march to Spain, where Pompey’s legates Petreius and Afranius were
ln command oi considerable icrces. Cicero theu saw that there was
no hope whatsoever oi peace, und determinsd to leave Italy.

This letter was written ln considerable excitemur, as is evident
irom the somewhat abrupi style, and especially the frequent omissione
oi words.

17. Philotimi: probably the ireedman referred to in Letter 22.
He is frequently mentioned ln the letters oi this period as a bearet oi
confidentlal dispatches. ·

18. exanimavit omnes: bassriphteced tlte lise out os all. The
fact that Philotimus’ fabricatione were usually in Pompey’s iavor
mede his present repert oi Ceesar’s success seem more credible.

19. obdurui : I bave proteu hardeaed.

20. volare dicitur: lte ie said to beyiytup forwerci.

21. coniunxisset: construe with dubitabat . . . uerno puin.
The united forces would contein five legions. adiert: sc. Philoti-
mue.

23. Pompeium . . . iecisse: presumably with the purpose oi
marching through Gaul and operating ln coniunctiori with his legates
in Spain. 0f course this rumor was absolutely untrus‚ and merely the
product oi the general excitament that prevailed at Rome.

24. tibairiade: ou pood authority. Melitam.. .cspesss·
mus2ueebouldmokesord1oito. The same construction occurs in
Epistulae ad Atticum, IX, 6, 2: sed, opinor, quiescamus. The sub-
junctive is probably to be explained as hcrtatory.

25. darn quid in Hispania: ie. dum sciamus quid in Hispania
apatur. On the ellipsis see the introduotcry note. Quod: ie. Meti-
taut capessere.

Paga 147. 1. caesaris litteris: Caesar had written while en
