Pago 116. liciter l. On his election to the tribunam, Clodius

immediately began his attack on Cicero. Among other measures
which be proposed wasone, that anyone who hed put to death Roman
citizens without trial, should be banished. It was evident that
this was directed against Cicero, who, more confused than helped
hythe conflictlng opinions oi his iriends as to what he should do,
and deserted utterly by Pompey‚ finally yielded to the advice oi
those who urged him to leave Rome, and departed towards the end oi
March, 58 nc. On the same day Clodius brought iorward ebill ban-
lshlng Cicero by name. Bytho terme oi the deorse he was not allowed
to reslde wlthln four hundred miles oi Rome. His property was in
large part confiscated or destroyed. The site 01 his razed house on
the Palatino Clodius was dedicated to Libertus.

Letteri was written from Thurii ln Bruttium when Cicero prob-
ably was on his way from Vibo, where he hed etayed two weelrs with
hls friend Sicca, whence in May he went to Brundisium and thence to
Thessalonica, where he remeined in the house 01 Cn. Plancius, his
intimate friend. The letters written during Cicero’s exile are the
letters oi a broken-bearted man, overwlrelmed by the sudden and un·
expected ware of misiortune which had taken irom him all he held dear.

ishment and the price oi parting irom those he iered, while bis

memory would bave been unstained.
