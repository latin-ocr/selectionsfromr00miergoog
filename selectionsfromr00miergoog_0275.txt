irom western Asia Minor luto Cilicia. It is described briefly by
Xenophon, Anah. 1. 2, 21.

4. manum: the Amanus is a section oi the Taurus Mountaim,
running ina northeaaterly direction from the Mediterranean toward
the Euphrates. It formed the boundary between Cilicia and Syria.

8. Pomptini: Pomptinus was Cicero‘s legate, and a man who
apparently had some real knowledge oi variare.

9. Imperatores appellati mmor: the “editorial plural.'’ The
title was conterred on the battlefleld by the acidiora, and lts bestowal
indicated that a considerable victory had been von, although in the
absence oi any rule determlning the extent of the victory ιο be followed

a letter to Marcus Caelius Rufus (Epistulae od Familiares 11 10)
Cicero writes that the acclamation took place at Issus, the scene οι
Alexander¹s victory over Darius.

which contained laurel leaves. consequently the expression means
“ to get laurels easily.‘'

or, if sui porteris is taken separately it may mean “ons oi his (ie.
Bibulus') own kind‚'’ an aristocrat. There is no reason to suppose
