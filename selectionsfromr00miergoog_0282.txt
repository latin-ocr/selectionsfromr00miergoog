betur 18. Marcus Porcius cato was the great-grandson of the
famous Cato the Censor, and was very proud of the fact. At this
time he was about 46 years old, and for some years had been promi-
nent in politice. He was an extreme conservative, on every occasion
he took a mand for the rights of the senate, and uncompromisingly
opposed any infringement oi its powers, even ιο the extent oi alienat-
ing the Equites who might otherwise have supported the Senate against
its democratia opponents. He opposed the policies of the Triumvirs so
consistently that, in the year in which they had Cicero exiled, they got
rid of him by sending him to Cyprus ιο take over the island and the
treasures which had been bequeathed to Rome by the deceased king,
Ptolemy Alexander. After Caesar left Romofor Gaul and Pompey
gradually identified himself with the Senate’s opposition ιο Caesar,
Cato’s influente increased greatly, and at the time oi this letter he was
one of the leaders of the conservative party. subsequently, in the
civil War he was one of the most trusted generals of Pompey, and
after the latter's defeat and death, he went with other uncompromis-
ing opponente oi Caesar ιο Africa in the hope oi forming an army
strong enough ιο maintain the constitutional government. Such hopes
were crushed by Caesar’s victory et Thapsus in 46, and thereupon
Cato, steadiastly refusing to submit ιο his political enemy, committed
suicide at Utica.

For a virid, but rather unfavorable, estimate oi Cato see Mommsen,
flietorp os Rome, Book V, chap. 3.

The stid and almost pedantic style oi this letter is J‘ust what one
would expect of the writer. The flrst few sentences, particularly, are
construeted with a precision that is almost painful, containing, as they
do, flrst the main idea, then various elaboratione of it with subordinate
ideas, and finally the verb.

Cicero had written to Cato (Epistulae ad Familiares, XV, 4) telling

ᾗ him of his aohieve'ments in Cilicia, and aaking him to propose ιο the

Senate to recognize (iicero’s services ιο the state by decreeing a aup-
plicotio, or solemn procession of all the citizens ιο the various temples

, in the city for the purpose of offering sacrifices and praise ιο the gods.

Such thanksgiving ceremonies were frequently ordered after notable
victorias. Cato made a speech that was highly complimentary ιο
Cicero, and seems to have made somensort of a motion tendering

a! him a vote of thanks, buthe refrained from proposing the supplicatio.
