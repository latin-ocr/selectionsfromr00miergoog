letter 19. Cicero's 1·eply ιο Letter 18.

’1. Laetus aum: a trocheis line from the Hector Roflchcens oi
Naevius. Cicero quotes it iu another letter (Epistulae od Familiares,
V, 12), and also in his Tusculanae Disputationes, IV, 67. The inser-
tion of opinor le therefore only an affectation, and due apparently ιο
the tear (which is not uncommon nowadays) ol seeming ιο know ιοο
much.

10. ligo vero: strictly the subject of the relative clause, hut
thrown out of its clause in order to give it greater emphasis. Cicero
frequently uses this expression at the beginning of e letter ιο introduce
the answer to a remark or question in e letter ιο which he is replying.
This seems to he the sense in which it isused here: pes, indeed, there
is nothinp which, etc. gratulatione litterarum tuarum: the
compltment contained in pour letter.

1³. quod liquido veritati dares: what witha clear conscience ’
pou could prout in the triturante os truth. Liquido is used in thia same
sense in Terence, Andria, 729. The clause seems to suggest that
Cicero would have liked Cato to streteh the truth a little.

14. al non modo omnes, verum etiam multi : even ry, I will not
sup all, hut at least many.

16. tua laudatione ι pour eulopy os me.

1⁷. ad: according to. illud ducatum aa subtile: a really
sranlc ancl urrhiased.

la. laudabilius: not used in the ordinary sense of praiseroorthp,
but with the meaning oi laudatorp.

20. voluntatis: his wishioratriumph. Ι
21. superioribus litteris: see Epistulae ad Familiares, XV, l,
13-14, where he coniesses ιο Cato that ever since his exile he hasbeen
anxious ιο obtain as many honora as possible in order to regain his

former prestige. quae: the antecedent is uoluntas.

22. rationem: aspect.

2⁵. usluto: in the previous year, Lentulus Spinther, the prede-
cessor ot Appius Claudius Pulcher in the governorship of Cilicia, had
been granted atriumph in recognition oi hie military aohievemente,
which were probably uo greater than Cicero's.
