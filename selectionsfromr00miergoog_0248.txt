Norus ΟΝ SALLUST'S CATILINE Ι 233

³1. abdicato magistratu ε the reason is given by Cicero (tn Oct.

3, lb): ct quoe religio 0. Morio, clarissimo ciro, non sceret qno minus
0. Glauciam de qao nibil nominatim erat decretum praetorem

occideret, eo nos rettptone lupricato P. Lentulo puniendo liberaremur.
ln liberis custodiis: a prisoner of rank accused οι a crime against
the state might be kept under artent in the home oi a magistrate or
even in his own house.

³2. Ρ. Lentulo Spintheri: he was consul in 57, and on the first
day oi his term of obice moved that Cicero he recalled irem exile.

Pege 87. 1. sedilis: the curule aedileship wesen office estab-
lished in 366 ιο oliset the plebeiae aedileship, and ewes its name ιο
the lact that those elected to this office (ior which none but patricians
were eligible) had the right ιο sit in the curule cheiras well as ιο wear
the bordered toga and ιο keep in their atrio waxen maske ol them-
selves ιο ιο handed down ιο posterity (ins imaginum). Their prin-
cipal duties were, as in the ease oi the plebeian aediles, the curo orote
or preservation of order in Rome, the carc annonae or supervision
oi the grain supply, end the carc ludorum or charge οι the gemes
Q. cornificio: he had been one οι the unsuccessiul candidates for
the consulship in the electione in which Cicero and Antonius were
chosen. 0. caesari: ιι, as Mommsen believes (IV, 486), Caesar and
Crassus were really impliceted in the conspiracy, Cicero's purpose in
making them personally responsible ior these two minor conspirators
was ιο force them either to avow their own part in the plot by conniv-
iug at their subordinates’ escape or else ιο pose as innocent of all
connection with it, and thus make possible the execution ol the
prisoners, which would have been diffioult to accomplieh if they were
known to be only the tools oi the democratia leaders. In the latter
case they would, oi course, be compromised in the eyes οι their
followers as well.
