Pege 142. Letter 23. This letter shows that Cicero's opinion, as

expressed in Letter 22, that Pompey would leave Domitius tobis fate,
was well founded. Pompey had, in fact, ordered Domitius to evacu-

operate against Caesar. The obstinate Domitius had not obeyed the
summoue, and it was now too late ior him to get away from Corfinium.
On the receipt oi this letter, realizing that he was in adsaporato posi-
