Ianitor 21. This letter is of great interest, containing, as it does, an
enumeration of the various possibilities that suggested themselves to
Cicero as solutions of the immediate politioal situation. The letter
was written only a iew days aiter a long interview with Pompey at
Formiae in southern Latium, and probably represents Pompey’s sum-
ming-up oi the situation. Immediately eiterthis interview Cicero wrote
to Atticus that Pompey had not shown any desire ior a reconciliation
with Caesar ; see Epistulae addititiam VII, 8. Itis noteworthythat
Cicero does not include among these possibilities the proposal made to
the 'senate hy Caeser's agent Curio that Caesar and Pompey should
resign their commands simultaneously. This had been passed hythe
Senate on Dec. l, but Pompey had ignored the order, and was evidently
refusing to consider such en action es among the possibilities. As
a matter oi ieet, however, just this compromise was offered as an ulti-
matum by Caesar on ian. i, 49, but the consuls refused to allow the
proposition to come te a vote.
