Letter 2. rr. cicero s. n. c. Autome Μ. r. nna: nr. croco
salutem dicit 0. Antonio Marci filio imperatori. Gaius Antonius,
Cicero‘s colleague iu the consulship, 63 n.c.‚ had, through Cicero's not
altogether disinterested aid, received the province oi Macedonia as
proconsul. This letter is written to introduce Atticus and tc com-
mend him and his business in Macedonia to Antonius' attention.
Cicero's relations with Antonius had become somewhat strained‚ proh-
ahly as a result ci Cicero's acts during their consulship and Cicero's
suhsequcnt unpopularity‚ in additionto certain later causes which are
hinted at in this letter. Sec Att. Ι, 12. 1-2.
