that, according ιο jurista this new law did not render the persons of the
mag'strates mentioned sacrosanct, but provided a punishment ior the
violation oi such magistrates. Hence a higher magistrate could anesi
an aedile and talre the rislr oi prosecution under this law. Tribunus,
however, were made sacrosanct not by this lau, but hy the cath swern
by the plebs when the tribunate was established ; hence a violation of

them even by a high magistrate was, not an offence against this law,
but high treason.
