11 li. Antonius had become involved in difficulties in his province,
and talk, apparently smanatlng from Antonius, was connecting Cicero
with the missppropriation of money. Certainly Pompey was intend·
ing ιο move Antonius’ supersession. Further, Antonius wesin debt
ιο Cicero, and the latter expresses, in the letter to Atticus cited above,
his firm resolution not to defend him. In this letter (lines 19 ii.) he
