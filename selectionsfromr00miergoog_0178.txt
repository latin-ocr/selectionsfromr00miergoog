patrician magistrate to another, and was the special province of the
Collega oi Pontifis. To remedy this, ten men called decemvirs were
appointed and the result of the whole agitation was the promulgation
oi a Cede, the Twelve Tables, in nc. 449. Further efforts (probably
in the same year) oi the plebeians to improve their condition are here
told by Livy.

⁸ Paga 8. 24. interregem: according to Livy’s account, no eon-

suls had been elected while the decemviro were in office; tbe latter
were finally forced out of office and an interrex was appointed—An
interrex was an extraordinary official appointed irum the patrician
members nithe Senatu, when ior any reason the state was leit without
chief magistrates. He held the powers oi tbe obici magistracy ior not
more thano days and was then obliged either to appoint a successor
or to hold an election oi consuls (the first interrex apparently did not
have the auspices and could not hold an election). The period during
which tha state was governed by interreges was called an interregnum.
