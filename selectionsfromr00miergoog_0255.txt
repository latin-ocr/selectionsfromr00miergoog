NOTES ΟΝ ClCERO'S LETTERS

Pege 105. liciter 1. Τ. Pomponius Atticus, ιο whose close
friendship with Cicero we are indebted ior a great part oi our intimate
knowledge oi the latter, was born about 109 nc. oi an old equestrian
family. When he was still ayoung man, he leit home ior Athens,
where he spent twenty-two years, returning in 65 ac. to assist Cicero
in his candidacy ior the consulship. Atticus was very wealthy both
from inheritances and from his own successful business operations,
which consisted largely in lending money at interest. He aided
Cicero and other friends ethome financially. Trained in the same
manner, he acquired tastes in literature and in art similar ιο Cicero's,
so that Cicero frequently asired his advice not only in regard to his
orations and other literary works hut employed him to collect works
of art lor his villas. On political questione, too, Cicero consulted him
hut received only scanty direction. It is plain, however, that Atticus
did not share Cicero’s laith in Pompey and was not inclined to taire
sides in the struggle between Pompey and Caesar in 49 rac. In fact
he kept alooi from politico, as no doubt his business interests de-
manded and as his universal popularity indicates. He was married on
the 13th oi February, iil n.c.‚ to Pilia. He had a daughter who was
married to M. Vipsanius Agrippa and became the mother oi Vipsania
Agrippa, the wife of Tiberius Nero. ln spite oi his great wealth and
estates in Italy and ahroad, Atticus lived moderately and without os·
tentation. Ile died at the age oi seventyseven. His sister Pomponia
was the wife oi Quintus Cicer0, the brother oi Marcus.
